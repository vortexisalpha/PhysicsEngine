# PhysicsEngine

Simple physics engine that simulates gravity, coefficient of restitution and circular motion by using further mechanics, physics and regular A level mechanics knowledge. 
Equations learned in class such as the simple pendulum equations or suvat have been applied in this engine through experimenting with different types of pendulum systems and bouncing balls. 
Length of pendulums can be adjusted.
